# Pulse

Pulse is a web framework built on top of signals.

This is my second attempt at a web framework to fix the mistakes made in `LampJs`, such as a lack of seperation between the state system and rendering pipeline.

The signals used in this framework are from [my signals library](https://github.com/JacksonO123/signals).
